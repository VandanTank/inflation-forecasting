# Advanced Time Series Forecasting of U.S. Inflation using SARIMA, ETS, and XGBoost Models

## 1. Project Objective üéØ

This project implements and evaluates multiple time series models for forecasting the **U.S. inflation rate**. The primary goal is to leverage historical Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to generate reliable short-term inflation predictions, comparing the efficacy of **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA/SARIMAX)**, **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**, and **XGBoost** methodologies. This work demonstrates proficiency in end-to-end time series analysis, including data acquisition, feature engineering, model selection, diagnostics, comparative evaluation, and forecasting.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Preparation üìä

* **Data Source:** Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database (`pandas-datareader`).
* **Target Series:** `CPIAUCSL` (U.S. CPI, All Urban Consumers, All Items, SA).
* **Exogenous Series:**
    * `UNRATE` (U.S. Civilian Unemployment Rate, SA).
    * `FEDFUNDS` (Effective Federal Funds Rate).
* **Frequency:** Monthly
* **Time Period:** 1960-01-01 to Present (dynamically updated on execution).
* **Target Variable:** YoY Percentage Change of `CPIAUCSL`.
* **Preprocessing:** Forward-filled missing values in exogenous series; aligned all series by date index.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìà

* Visualized the long-term YoY inflation rate (1961-Present) to identify trends, seasonality, and periods of volatility (e.g., 1970s energy crisis, 2009 recession, post-2020 surge). This informed the need for models capable of handling non-stationarity and seasonality.

## 4. Modeling Methodology üõ†Ô∏è

### 4.1. Train/Test Split

* Data split chronologically: ~80% Training (1961-01-01 to 2012-08-01), ~20% Testing (2012-09-01 to Present).

### 4.2. SARIMA / SARIMAX Models

* **Parameter Selection:** `pmdarima.auto_arima` used on training data (with and without exogenous variables) to find optimal parameters minimizing AIC. Seasonality (`m=12`) included.
* **Best Model Found:** `SARIMAX(0, 1, 3)x(0, 0, 1, 12)` identified for both (exogenous variables did not improve AIC fit on training data).
* **Diagnostics:** Residual analysis performed (plots: residuals, histogram, Q-Q, ACF) indicated a reasonable fit with no significant remaining autocorrelation.

### 4.3. ETS Model (Benchmark)

* **Specification:** ETS(A,Ad,A) - Additive Error, Additive Damped Trend, Additive Seasonality (`m=12`) fitted to training data.

### 4.4. XGBoost Model (Machine Learning)

* **Feature Engineering:** Created lagged features for inflation (lags 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months). Combined lags with exogenous variables (`UNRATE`, `FEDFUNDS`).
* **Model:** `xgboost.XGBRegressor` trained on the engineered features and target inflation from the training set. Standard hyperparameters used.

## 5. Evaluation and Results üéØ

Models were evaluated on the test set using RMSE and MAE:

| Model   | RMSE       | MAE        | Notes                                         |
| :------ | :--------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| SARIMA  | 2.0614     | 1.4520     | Baseline statistical model.                   |
| SARIMAX | 2.0614     | 1.4520     | Exog. variables didn't improve test metrics. |
| ETS     | 2.2708     | 1.4302     | Performed slightly worse than SARIMA.         |
| XGBoost | **0.4970** | **0.3668** | Significantly outperformed statistical models. |

* **Discussion:** The **XGBoost model demonstrated substantially better performance** on the test set, particularly in tracking the volatile post-2020 period. This highlights the advantage of feature engineering (lags) and machine learning algorithms for capturing complex dynamics in economic time series, especially during periods of structural change.

## 6. Future Forecast üîÆ

* The best-performing **XGBoost model** was re-trained on the *entire* dataset.
* An iterative prediction process was used to generate forecasts for the next **12 months** (Sep 2025 - Aug 2026), using predicted values to update future lag features (assuming exogenous variables remain constant).
* **Result:** The XGBoost model predicts inflation **to quickly stabilize and remain consistently around 2.86-2.88% over the next year.**
